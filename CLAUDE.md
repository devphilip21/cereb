# Project Guidelines for Claude Code

## Source Code Comment Rules

### Must Do
- Write all comments in English only
- Add comments for core models (interfaces or classes) explaining their responsibility, role, and design principles
- For complex functions (not simple mapping) exceeding 30 lines, add a summary comment explaining what the function does

### Must Not Do
- Do not leave comments just for section-dividing purposes
- Do not write comments for things that can be understood from the code alone
