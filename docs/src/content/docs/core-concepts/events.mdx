description: Low-level browser event handling in Cereb
---

Events are the lowest layer in Cereb's architecture. They represent raw browser input events (pointer, touch, mouse) that get transformed into higher-level abstractions.

## Event Types

Cereb handles three types of browser events:

### Pointer Events
Modern unified API that works across mouse, touch, and stylus inputs.

```typescript
import { fromPointerEvents } from "@cereb/stream";

const pointer$ = fromPointerEvents(element);
```

### Touch Events
Legacy API for multi-touch support on mobile devices.

```typescript
import { fromTouchEvents } from "@cereb/stream";

const touch$ = fromTouchEvents(element);
```

### Mouse Events
Traditional mouse-only API for desktop interactions.

```typescript
import { fromMouseEvents } from "@cereb/stream";

const mouse$ = fromMouseEvents(element);
```

## Event Flow

```
Browser Events → Stream → Signal → Gesture
     ↑              ↑         ↑        ↑
  Raw Input    Observable  Unified   Recognition
```

In most cases, you won't work with raw events directly. The Signal layer provides a unified interface that abstracts away these differences.
