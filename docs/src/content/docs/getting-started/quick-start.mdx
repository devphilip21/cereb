## Install Packages You Need

To keep the library lightweight, install only the packages you need.
Internally reused chunks are shared and built efficiently.

## Packages

<div class="table-outlined">

| Layer | Package | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Signal | [@cereb/single-pointer](/api/signal/single-pointer) | Unified pointer/touch/mouse input handling |
| Gesture | [@cereb/pan](/api/gesture/pan) | Pan gesture recognition with momentum and constraints |

</div>

## Example: Installing Pan Gesture

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @cereb/pan
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @cereb/pan
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @cereb/pan
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
