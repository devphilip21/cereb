# Quick Start

Suppose you want to handle a pinch gesture to implement zoom.
Let's build it step by step.

## 1. Install Packages

Cereb is modular—install only what you need.

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cereb` | Native events & operators |
| `@cereb/pan` | Pan/drag/swipe gesture |
| `@cereb/pinch` | Pinch/zoom gesture |
| `@cereb/tap` | Tap gesture |

For our pinch example:

```bash
npm install @cereb/pinch
```

> Gesture packages include `cereb` core as a dependency.

## 2. Create a Source Stream

Import `pinch` and create a stream from your target element:

```typescript
import { pinch } from "@cereb/pinch";

const stream = pinch(element);
```

## 3. Transform with pipe()

Chain operators to add constraints like scale limits:

```typescript
import { zoom } from "cereb/operators";

const stream = pinch(element).pipe(
  zoom({ minScale: 0.5, maxScale: 3 }),
);
```

## 4. Subscribe with on()

Nothing happens until you subscribe:

```typescript
stream.on((signal) => {
  const { phase, scale, center } = signal.value;
  const [cx, cy] = center;

  if (phase === "change") {
    applyZoom(scale, cx, cy);
  }
});
```
